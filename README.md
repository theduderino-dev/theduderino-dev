Hi! My name is Juan, I'm 17 years old and currently reside in a really small town, just 75 miles south of Albuquerque in New Mexico named Socorro. Hopefully, not for too much longer, I'm thinking about moving somewhere with more job opportunities, like San Diego or somewhere in the Bay Area. As long as it's in Cali, preferably close to Silicon Valley and affordable, I'm craving it.

As for my skillset and know-how, I'm experienced with languages like Go, Rust, C# and JavaScript, however to be honest, I'd prefer not to work directly with programming. I'm more interested in something related but simpler, like Embedded Systems, or perhaps Server Administration.
